Let's drop in
Baby let's drop in
You know it can't begin
Until we drop in

You gotta relax
C'mon baby relax
Aw just lay back
Release and relax

I know you feel it, yeah I can see it, baby
Once you've revealed it, you can't conceal it, baby
If you want to free it, you got to reach it, baby

Let's drop in
Let's drop in
Let's drop in
Let's drop in
Let's drop in
Let's do it again
And then again and again

Once you've revealed it, you can't conceal it, baby
If you want to free it, you got to reach it, baby
So let's unleash it and then repeat it, baby

Let's drop in
Let's drop in
Let's drop in
Let's drop in
