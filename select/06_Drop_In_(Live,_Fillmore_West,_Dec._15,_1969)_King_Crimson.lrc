[00:00.26] Why don't you just drop in
[00:09.59] And let the game begin?
[00:18.43] And squirm inside your cage
[00:27.67] You are a prisoner of your rage
[00:43.17] 
[00:35.96] Why don't you just drop in
[00:45.55] And love the life of sin?
[00:54.53] The rules you pick and choose
[01:03.85] The odds are stacked for you to lose
[01:21.85] 
[02:45.64] Why don't you just drop in
[02:54.30] And let the game begin?
[03:02.16] You'll wish you'd learn to play
[03:10.17] And live to die another day
[03:23.67] 
[03:54.41] Why don't you just drop in
[04:02.28] And love the life of sin?
[04:09.35] And squirm inside your cage
[04:16.21] You are a prisoner of your rage
[04:31.71] 
[04:25.53] Why don't you just... Drop...
[04:51.41] Drop... In...
