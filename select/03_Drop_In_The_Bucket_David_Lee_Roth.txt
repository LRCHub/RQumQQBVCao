Just like the army
I was bein' all I could be
I was feelin' next to awesome
In my cleanest dirty jeans

She said
"Honey read the small print
If ya wanna be with me
When it comes to you and fashion
You're a totally emergency!

Right up the middle
Touchdown and that's the game
Extra point and you're never the same
Tight as a fiddle string
Shot right through the brain
Graspin' straws an' that ain't all
You'll slip right down her drain
Drop at a time is all ya need
Try it once but easy does it!
Satisfaction guaranteed
Try it twice, ya gotta love it!
Drop at a time is all ya need

She said, "Look, just don't touch it!"
Well, here goes one more drop in the bucket!
She wore a whole lot of not enough
And served it up with class
Had a sunny disposition
And a somewhat shady past
Her t-shirt ended early
And her hot pants started late
When it came to vice and versa
No I did not hesitate

Aww right to the action
For a bird's eye view of the play
There ain't a promise that you won't make
Hike, and keep passin'
And ya play it with a little pain
You came here for some love and war

So suit up for the game!
Drop at a time is all ya need
Try it once but easy does it!
Satisfaction guaranteed
Try it twice, ya gotta love it!
Drop at a time is all ya need
She said, "Look, just don't touch it!"
Well, here come one more drop in the bucket!
Here come one more drop in the the bucket
Gotta get it one more
